.. _LearningMechanism_Overview:

Overview
--------

A LearningMechanism is an `AdaptiveMechanism <AdaptiveMechanism>` that modifies `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>`
of a `MappingProjection`.  Its function takes an `error_signal` (usually the output of an `ObjectiveMechanism` or
another `LearningMechanism`) and generates a `learning_signal` that is used to modify the MappingProjection by way of
a `LearningProjection`.  The MappingProjection(s) modified by a LearningMechanism must project from one
`ProcessingMechanism` to another in same `System` or `Process`. The learning components of a System can be displayed
using the System's `show_graph` method with its **show_learning** argument assigned :keyword:`True`. LearningMechanisms
are executed after all of the ProcessingMechanisms in a System or Process have been executed, and before any
`ControlMechanisms <ControlMechanism>` of the System have been executed.

.. _LearningMechanism_Creation:

Creating a LearningMechanism
----------------------------

LearningMechanisms can be created in any of the ways used to `create Mechanisms <Mechanism_Creation>`.
More commonly, however, they are created automatically when:

* the learning attribute is specified for a `System <System_Execution_Learning>` or `Process <Process_Learning>`;
..
* a `LearningProjection` (or the keyword `LEARNING`) is specified in a
  `tuple specification <MappingProjection_Tuple_Specification>` for a `MappingProjection` in the `pathway` of a Process;
..
* a `LearningProjection` is created without specifying its `sender <LearningProjection.sender>` attribute.

In these instances, an `ObjectiveMechanism`, `LearningProjection <LearningProjection>`, and any additional Projections
required to implement learning that do not already exist are also instantiated.  This is described below, under
`Learning Configurations <LearningMechanism_Learning_Configurations>`.

.. _LearningMechanism_Structure:

Structure
---------

A LearningMechanism has three `InputStates <InputState>`, a learning `function <LearningMechanism.function>`,
and two types of `OutputStates <OutputState>` that are used, respectively, to receive, compute, and transmit the
information needed to modify the MappingProjection(s) for which it is responsible.  In addition, it has several
attributes that govern its operation.  These are all described below.

.. _LearningMechanism_InputStates:

InputStates
~~~~~~~~~~~

These receive the information required by the LearningMechanism's `function <LearningMechanism_Function>`.  They are
listed in the LearningMechanism's `input_states <LearningMechanism.input_states>` attribute, and have the following
names and roles (shown in the `figure below <LearningMechanism_Single_Layer_Learning_Figure>`):

.. _LearningMechanism_Activation_Input:

* *ACTIVATION_INPUT* - receives the value of the input to the MappingProjection being learned (that is, the
  `value <MappingProjection.value> of the MappingProjection's `sender <MappingProjection.sender>`).
  The value is assigned as the first item of the LearningMechanism's `variable <LearningMechanism.variable>` attribute.

.. _LearningMechanism_Activation_Output:

* *ACTIVATION_OUTPUT* - receives the value of the LearningMechanism's
  `error_source <LearningMechanism_Additional_Attributes>` (that is, the output of the *ProcessingMechanism* to which
  the MappingProjection being learned projects).  By default, this uses the `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>`
  of the `error_source`.  However, a different OutputState can be designated in the constructor for the `error_source`,
  by assigning a `parameter specification dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>` to its **params**
  argument with an entry that uses *MONITOR_FOR_LEARNING* as its key and a list containing the desired
  OutputState(s) as its value.  The :keyword:`value` of the *ACTIVATION_OUTPUT* InputState is assigned as the
  second item of the LearningMechanism's `variable <LearningMechanism.variable>` attribute.

.. _LearningMechanism_Input_Error_Signal:

* *ERROR_SIGNAL* - receives the value of an `error_signal <LearningMechanism.error_signal>` from either an
  `ObjectiveMechanism` or another LearningMechanism. If the MappingProjection being learned projects to the `TERMINAL`
  Mechanism of the Process or System being learned, or is not part of a
  `multilayer learning sequence <LearningMechanism_Multi_Layer>`, then the `error_signal` comes from an
  ObjectiveMechanism. If the MappingProjection being learned is part of a multilayer learning sequence,
  then the `error_signal` comes from the next LearningMechanism in the sequence (i.e., the layer "above"
  the current one).  The value of the *ERROR_SIGNAL* InputState is assigned as the third item of the LearningMechanism's
  `variable <LearningMechanism.variable>` attribute.

   .. note::
      The value of a LearningMechanism's *ERROR_SIGNAL* InputState is distinct from its
      `error_signal <LearningMechanism.error_signal>` attribute. The former is received from an ObjectiveMechanism or
      another LearningMechanism, whereas the latter is generated as a result of the LearningMechanism's
      `function <LearningMechanism.function>` (and potentially passed on to other LearningMechanisms).

.. _LearningMechanism_Function:

Learning Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This uses the three values received by the LearningMechanism's InputStates
(described `above <LearningMechanism_InputStates>` to calculate the value of its `learning_signal` and
`error_signal <LearningMechanism.error_signal>` attributes.  The `learning_signal` is the set
of changes to the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of the MappingProjection being learned
calculated to reduce the value of the LearningMechanism's *ERROR_SIGNAL* InputState .  In `multilayer
learning <LearningMechanism_Multi_Layer>`, the :keyword:`error_signal`
reflects the contribution made to vaue of the *ERROR_SIGNAL* inputstate by the input to the
MappingProjection being learned, weighted by the current value of its `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter
(i.e., before it has been modified). The default `function <LearningMechanism.function>` of a LearningMechanism is
`BackPropagation` (also known as the *Generalized Delta Rule*; see
`Rumelhart et al., 1986 <http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v323/n6088/abs/323533a0.html>`_).  However, it can be
assigned to be any other PsyNeuLink `LearningFunction`, or any other Python function that takes as its input a value
with three 1d arrays or lists, and returns two 1d arrays or lists.  The two return values it returns are assigned to
the LearningMechanism's `learning_signal` and `error_signal <LearningSignal.error_signal>` attributes, respectively,
as well as to its two OutputStates, as described below.

.. _LearningMechanism_OutputStates:

OutputStates
~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, a LearningMechanism has two OutputStates that receive, respectively, the
`error_signal <LearningMechanism.error_signal>` and  `learning_signal` values returned by the LearningMechanism's
`function <LearningMechanism.function>`.

.. _LearningMechanism_Output_Error_Signal:

* *ERROR_SIGNAL* - receives the value of the error signal used to calculate the `learning_signal`, which may have been
  weighted by the contribution of the MappingProjection being learned and the `error_source` made to the value of
  the error signal received by the LearningProjection (i.e., the value of its *ERROR SIGNAL* InputState (see
  `above <LearningMechanism_Input_Error_Signal>`.  This is always a LearningMechanism's first (i.e.,
  `primary <OutputState_Primary>`) OutputState, and is always named *ERROR_SIGNAL*.  Its value is assigned as the
  value of the LearningMechanism's `learning_signal` attribute, and as the first item of the LearningMechanism's
  `output_values <LearningMechanism.output_values>` attribute.  If the LearningMechanism is part of a
  `multilayer learning sequence <LearningMechanism_Multi_Layer>`, the *ERROR_SIGNAL* OutputState is assigned a
  a Projection to the LearningMechanism for the previous MappingProjection being learned in the sequence -
  see `figure <LearningMechanism_Multilayer_Learning_Figure>` below).

.. _LearningMechanism_Learning_Signal:

* `LearningSignals` - these are a special class of OutputState that receive the matrix of weight changes calculated by
  a LearningMechanism's function and use this to modify the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` of a
  `MappingProjection` being learned.  By default a LearningMechanism has just one LearningSignal.  It is assigned as
  the second item in the list of the LearningMechanism's OutputStates (i.e., in its
  `output_states <LearningMechanism.output_states>` attribute).  Its `value <LearningSignal.value>` is assigned as the
  value of the LearningMechanism's `learning_signal` attribute, and as the second item of the LearningMechanism's
  `output_values <LearningMechanism.output_values>` attribute.  It is also assigned as the
  `sender <LearningProjection.sender>` of the *LearningProjection* that projects to the MappingProjection being
  learned.  Though not common, it is possible to assign more than one LearningSignal to a LearningMechanism (e.g.,
  in order to "yoke" the learning of multiple MappingProjections to a single LearningMechanism).  This can be done by
  specifying multiple LearningSignals in a list assigned to the **learning_signals** argument of the LearningMechanism's
  constructor.  All of the LearningSignals are assigned the same value (i.e., weight change matrix), however each can
  be assigned a LearningProjection to a different MappingProjection, although all of them must have matrix parameters
  with the same shape.  The LearningSignals can use different values for their
  `learning_rate <LearningSignal.learning_rate>` and `modulation <LearningSignal.modulation>` attributes.
  All of the LearningSignals of a LearningMechanism are listed in its `learning_signals` attribute (in addition to its
  `output_states <LearningMechanism.output_states>` attribute), and all of their LearningProjections are listed in the
  LearningMechanism's `learning_projections` attribute.

.. _LearningMechanism_Additional_Attributes:

Additional Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to its State and function, a LearningMechanism has the following attributes that refer to the
components being learned and/or its operation:

* `learned_projection` - the MappingProjection for which the LearningMechanism is responsible;  that is, the one with
  the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter that the LearningMechanism modifies;
..
* `error_source` - the Mechanism that receives the `learned_projection`;  that is, the one that generates the output
  used to calculate the error signal that the LearningMechanism attempts to reduce.
..
* `learning_signals` - the list of all of the LearningMechanism's LearningSignals that have been assigned to the
  LearningMechanism in the **learning_signals** argument of its constructor.
..
* `learning_projections` - the list of LearningProjections for all of the LearningMechanism's LearningSignals;
..
* `modulation` - this specifies the way in which the `learning_signal <LearningMechanism.learning_signal>` is used
  to modify the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of the `learned_projection`.  By default its value is
  Modulation.ADD, which causes the weight changes in the `learning_signal` to be added to the current value of the
  `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter (see `LearningMechanism_Execution` for a description of how the
  modifications are executed).
..
.. _LearningMechanism_Learning_Rate:

* `learning_rate <LearningMechanism.learning_rate>` - the learning rate for the LearningMechanism.  This is used to
  specify the :keyword:`learning_rate` parameter for its `function <LearningMechanism.function>`.  In general, the
  `learning_rate <LearningMechanism.learning_rate>` multiplies the weight changes provided by the LearningMechanism to
  its `function <LearningMechanism.function>` before conveying these to the `LearningSignal` used to modify the
  MappingProjection's `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter. Specifying the
  `learning_rate <LearningMechanism.learning_rate>` for LearningMechanism (or the :keyword:`learning_rate` parameter
  of its `function <LearningMechanism.function>` directly) supersedes any specification of the :keyword:`learning_rate`
  for any `Process <Process.Process_Base.learning_rate>` and/or `System <System.System_Base.learning_rate>` to which
  the LearningMechanism belongs.  The default value for a LearningMechanism's `learning_rate <LearningMechanism>`
  attribute is `None`, in which case the LearningMechanism (and its `function <LearningMechanism.function>`) inherit
  the specification of the `learning_rate <Process.Process_Base.learning_rate>` for the Process in which the
  LearningMechanism is executed. If that is `None`, then it inherits it from the System in which it is executed.  If
  that is also `None`, then it uses the default value assigned by its `function <LearningMechanism.function>`.
  Learning rate can also be specified individually for `LearningSignals <LearningSignal>` and/or their associated
  `LearningProjections <LearningProjection>`.  Those have a direct multiplicative effect on the
  LearningProjection's `learning_signal <LearningProjection.learning_signal>` used to modify the weight matrix of the
  `learning_projection <LearningMechanism.learned_projection>`
  (see `LearningSignal learning_rate <LearningSignal_Learning_Rate>` for additional details).

COMMENT:
@@@ THE FOLLOWING SECTION SHOULD BE MOVED TO THE "USER'S MANUAL" WHEN THAT IS WRITTEN
COMMENT
.. _LearningMechanism_Learning_Configurations:

Learning Configurations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When learning is specified for a `MappingProjection`, a `Process <Process_Learning>`, or a
`System <System_Execution_Learning>`, PsyNeuLink automatically creates all of the components required for the
`MappingProjections <MappingProjection>` between `ProcessingMechanisms <ProcessingMechanism>` in that composition to
be learned.  The type of components that are generated depends on the :ref:`learning function <LearningFunction>`
specified, and the configuration of the composition.  All of the learning components of a System can be displayed
using the System's `show_graph` method with its **show_learning** argument assigned :keyword:`True`.

.. _LearningMechanism_Single_Layer:

Single layer learning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the case when only a single MappingProjection is specified for learning, or the LearningMechanism's function
only considers the output of its `error_source <LearningMechanism_Additional_Attributes>`  when computing the changes
that will be made to the `learned_projection's  <LearningMechanism_Additional_Attributes>`
`matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` (e.g., `Reinforcement`).  In this case, a single `ObjectiveMechanism` and
LearningMechanism are created for the `learned_projection <LearningMechanism_Additional_Attributes>`, if they do not
already exist, along with the following MappingProjections:

* from an OutputState of the LearningMechanism's `error_source <LearningMechanism_Additional_Attributes>` to the
  ObjectiveMechanism's `SAMPLE` :ref:`InputState <LINK>`.  By default, the
  `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>` of the error_souce is used;
  however, this can be modified by specifying its `MONITOR_FOR_LEARNING` parameter
  (see `above <LearningMechanism_Activation_Output>`).

* from the Process or System to the ObjectiveMechanism's `TARGET` :ref:`InputState <LINK>`;

* from the ObjectiveMechanism's `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>` to the LearningMechanism's
  `ERROR_SIGNAL <LearningMechanism_Activation_Input>` InputState .

In addition, a `LearningProjection` is created from the LearningMechanism's
`LEARNING_SIGNAL <LearningMechanism_Learning_Signal>` OutputState to the `matrix` `ParameterState`
for the `learned_projection <LearningMechanism_Additional_Attributes>`.  Because this case involves only a single
layer of learning, *no* Projection is created or assigned to the LearningMechanism's
`ERROR_SIGNAL <LearningMechanism_Output_Error_Signal>` OutputState.

       ObjectiveMechanism, LearningMechanism and associated Projections created for a single learned_projection
       and error_source.  Each Mechanism is labeled by its type (upper line, in bold) and its designated
       status in the Process and/or System to which it belongs (lower line, caps).  Italicized labels beside a
       component indicates the attribute of the LearningMechanism with which it is associated.


.. _LearningMechanism_Multi_Layer:

Multilayer learning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the case when a set of MappingProjections are being learned that are in a sequence (such as the `pathway` of a
Process); that is, in which each projects to a ProcessingMechanism that is the `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` for
the next MappingProjection in the sequence (see the `figure <LearningMechanism_Multilayer_Learning_Figure>` below).
This requires the use of a learning function that can calculate the influence that each MappingProjection and its input
have on the error that the LearningMechanism receives from the next one in the sequence (e.g., `BackPropagation`).
In multilayer learning, the components created depend on the position of the
`learned_projection <LearningMechanism_Additional_Attributes>` and
`error_source <LearningMechanism_Additional_Attributes>` in the sequence.  If these are the last ones in the
sequence, they are treated in the same way as `single layer learning <LearningMechanism_Single_Layer>`.  This is the
case if the `error_source` is a standalone Mechanism (one not in a Process or System), the `TERMINAL` Mechanism of a
standalone Process (i.e., one not in a System), or the `TERMINAL` of all of the Processes to which it belongs in a
System (and therefore a `TERMINAL` for the System).  In these cases, as for single layer learning,
an `ObjectiveMechanism` is created that receives the output of the `error_source` as well as the target for learning
(see `LearningMechanisms_Targets` below), and projects to a LearningMechanism that is created for the
`learned_projection`.  For all others, the following MappingProjections are created (shown in the `figure
<LearningMechanism_Multilayer_Learning_Figure>` below):

* from the `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` of the `learned_projection` to the LearningMechanism's
  `ACTIVATION_INPUT` `InputState <LearningMechanism_Activation_Input>`.
..
* from the `error_source` to the LearningMechanism's
  `ACTIVATION_OUTPUT` `InputState <LearningMechanism_Activation_Output>`.
..
* from the `ERROR_SIGNAL <LearningMechanism_Output_Error_Signal>` OutputState of the LearningMechanism for the
  next MappingProjection in the sequence (i.e., the layer "above" it) to the LearningMechanism's
  `ERROR_SIGNAL <LearningMechanism_Input_Error_Signal>` InputState.

In addition, a `LearningProjection` is created from each LearningMechanism's
`LEARNING_SIGNAL <LearningMechanism_Learning_Signal>` OutputState to the `matrix` `ParameterState`
of its `learned_projection`.  If the `learned_projection` is the first in the sequence, then *no* Projection is
created or assigned to its LearningMechanism's `ERROR_SIGNAL <LearningMechanism_Output_Error_Signal>` OutputState.

.. _LearningMechanism_Multilayer_Learning_Figure:

    **Components for Multilayer Learning**

    .. figure:: _static/LearningMechanism_Multilayer_Learning_fig.svg
       :alt: Schematic of Mechanisms and Projections involved in learning for a sequence of MappingProjections
       :scale: 50%

       ObjectiveMechanism and LearningMechanisms and associated Projections created for a sequence of two
       MappingProjections specified for learning.  Each Mechanism is labeled by its type (uppler line, in bold) and
       its designated status in the Process and/or System to which it belongs (lower line, caps).  Italicized labels
       beside a component indicates the attribute of the LearningMechanism with which it is associated.

.. _LearningMechanism_Targets:

**TARGET Mechanisms**: receive the targets specified for learning.  When learning is specified for a `Process
<Process_Learning>` or `System <System_Execution_Learning>`, the `ObjectiveMechanism`  that will receive its
`targets <Run_Targets>` (specified in the call to its :keyword:`execute` or :keyword:`run` method) are identified and
designated as `TARGET` Mechanisms. These are listed in the Process' or System's `target_mechanisms` attribute.
It is important to note that the status of a `ProcessingMechanism` in a System takes precedence over its status in any
of the Processes to which it belongs. This means that even if a Mechanism is the `TERMINAL` of a particular Process,
if that Process is combined with others in a System, the Mechanism appears in any of those other Processes,
and it is not the `TERMINAL` of all of them, then it will *not* be the `TERMINAL` for the System.  As consequence,
although it will project to a `TARGET` Mechanism in the Process for which it is the `TERMINAL`, it will not do so in
the System (see :ref:`figure below <LearningProjection_Target_vs_Terminal_Figure>` for an example).  Finally, if a
Mechanisms is the `TERMINAL` for more than one Process used to create a System (that is, the pathways for those
Processes converge on that Mechanism), only one ObjectiveMechanism will be created for it in the System.

.. _LearningProjection_Target_vs_Terminal_Figure:

    **TERMINAL** and **TARGET** Mechanisms in Learning

    .. figure:: _static/LearningMechanism_TERMINAL_vs_TARGET_fig.svg
       :alt: Schematic of Mechanisms and Projections involved in learning
       :scale: 50 %

       Mechanism 3 is the `TERMINAL` Mechanism for Process A, However, it is also an `INTERNAL` Mechanism of Process B.
       Therefore, Mechanism 3 is designated as an `INTERNAL` Mechanism for the System, and Mechanism 4 is its `TERMINAL`
       Mechanism. As a consequence, if `BackPropagation` is used for learning, then Mechanism 4 is an
       `ObjectiveMechanism` and designated as a `TARGET`, while Mechanism 3 is a LearningMechanism
       and designated as a `LEARNING` Mechanism.

.. _LearningMechanism_Execution:

Execution
---------

LearningMechanisms are executed after all of the ProcessingMechanisms in the Process or System to which it belongs have
been executed, including the ObjectiveMechanism(s) that provide an error signal to the LearningMechanism(s).  When a
LearningMechanism is executed, it uses the value of its `ERROR_SIGNAL <LearningMechanism_Input_Error_Signal>`
InputState to calculate changes to the `matrix <MappingProjection.MappingProjection.matrix>` of the MappingProjections
being learned.  That value is assigned to its `learning_signal` attribute, as the value of each of the LearningSignals
in its `learning_signal` attribute, and as the value of each of their LearningProjections.  That value is used,
in turn, to modify the value of the `MATRIX` ParameterState of each of the MappingProjections being learned
(listed in the LearningMechanism's `learned_projections` attribute).  Each ParameterState uses the value it receives
from the `LearningProjection` to modify the parameter of its function in a manner specified by the
`modulation <LearningSignal.modulation>` attribute of the `LearningSignal` from which it receives the
LearningProjection (see `modulation <ModulatorySignals_Modulation>` for a description of State value modulation).
By default, the `modulation <LearningSignal.modulation>` attribute of a LearningSignal is Modulation.ADD,
the `function <ParameterState.function>` of a `MATRIX` ParameterState for a MappingProjection is
`Accumulator`, and the parameter it uses for `additive modulation` is its `increment <Accumulator.increment>`.  These
assignments cause the value of a LearningProjection to be added to the previous value of the `MATRIX` ParameterState,
thus incrementing the weights by the `learning_signal` specified by the LearningMechanism.  Note, however, that these
changes are not applied to the `matrix <MappingProjection.MappingProjection.matrix>` itself until the next
time the `learned_projection` is executed (see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation <LINK>` for an explanation of "lazy" updating).
In addition to computing and conveying its `learning_signal`, the LearningMechanism's
`function <LearningMechanism.function>` also computes an error signal that is assigned to its
`error_signal <LearningMechanism.error_signal>` attribute and as the value of its *ERROR_SIGNAL* OutputState.

    COMMENT:
        Description:
            LearningMechanism is a subtype of the AdaptiveMechanism Type of the Mechanism Category of Component
            It implements a Mechanism that calculates changes to a Projection's parameters.
            It's function takes the output of an ObjectiveMechanism (self.variable) and generates a
            learning_signal (ndarray of parameter changes) to be used by the recipient of a LearningProjection
            that projects from the LearningMechanism to a MappingProjection.

    COMMENT

    Arguments
    ---------

    variable : List or 2d np.array
        specifies a template for the three items required by the `function <LearningMechanism.function>`: the input
        to the `learned_projection`, the output of the `error_source`, and the error_signal received by the
        LearningMechanism (see `variable <LearningMechanism.variable>` for details).

    error_source : ProcessingMechanism
        specifies the Mechanism that generates the output on which the error_signal received by the LearningMechanism
        (in its `ERROR_SIGNAL <LearningMechanism_Input_Error_Signal>` InputState) is based.

    learning_signals : List[parameter of Projection, ParameterState, Projection, tuple[str, Projection] or dict]
        specifies the parameter(s) to be trained by the LearningMechanism
        (see `learning_signals <LearningMechanism.learning_signals>` for details).

    modulation : ModulationParam : ModulationParam.ADDITIVE
        specifies the default form of modulation used by the LearningMechanism's LearningSignals,
        unless they are `individually specified <LearningSignal_Specification>`.

    function : LearningFunction or function
        specifies the function used to compute the `learning_signal` used by a LearningProjection, and the
        and `error_signal` passed to the next LearningMechanism in a
        `learning sequence <LearningMechanism_Learning_Configurations>`
        (see `function <LearningMechanism.function>` for details).

    learning_rate : float
        specifies the learning rate for this LearningMechanism
        (see `learning_rate <LearningMechanism.learning_rate>` for details).

    params : Optional[Dict[param keyword, param value]]
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>` that specifies the parameters for the
        Projection, its function, and/or a custom function and its parameters. By default, it contains an entry for
        the Projection's default `function <LearningProjection.function>` and parameter assignments.  Values specified
        for parameters in the dictionary override any assigned to those parameters in arguments of the constructor.

    name : str : default LearningProjection-<index>
        a string used for the name of the LearningProjection.
        If not is specified, a default is assigned by ProjectionRegistry
        (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : Optional[PreferenceSet or specification dict : Projection.classPreferences]
        the `PreferenceSet` for the LearningProjection.
        If it is not specified, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py
        (see :doc:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).


    Attributes
    ----------

    componentType : LEARNING_PROJECTION

    variable : 2d np.array
        specifies three items: 1) the input to the `learned_projection`; 2) the output of the `error_source`; and
        the error signal received from either an ObjectiveMechanism or the next LearningMechanism in a
        `learning sequence <LearningMechanism_Learning_Configurations>`.

    size : int, list or np.ndarray of ints
        specifies variable as array(s) of zeros if **variable** is not passed as an argument;
        if **variable** is specified, it takes precedence over the specification of **size**.

    COMMENT:
      error_output : 1d np.array
            the output of the next Mechanism in the pathway (the one to which the `error_signal` pertains, and projected
            to by the Mechanism that receives the Projection being learned). Typically this comes from  the
            `LearningMechanism` for that next Mechanism.  However, if the current LearningMechanism is for the last
            Mechanism in a sequence of Mechanisms being learned (often, but not necessarily a `TERMINAL` Mechanism),
            then error_output is set to an array of 1's with a length equal to the length of the `error_signal`.

        error_source : ObjectiveMechanism or LearningMechanism
            the Mechanism from which the LearningMechanism gets its `error_signal`.  The LearningMechanism receives a
            Projection from the `error_source` to its `ERROR_SIGNAL <LearningMechanism.input_states>` InputState.
            If the `error_source` is an ObjectiveMechanism, the Projection is from its
            `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>`.  If the `error_source` is another LearningMechanism,
            the Projection is from its `ERROR_SIGNAL <LearningMechanism.outputStates>` OutputState.  In either case,
            the MappingProjection uses an `IDENTITY_MATRIX`, and so the value of the OutputState used for the
            `error_source` must be equal in length to the value of the LearningMechanism's `ERROR_SIGNAL` inputstate.
    COMMENT

    input_states : ContentAddressableList[OutputState]
        list containing the LearningMechanism's three `InputStates <LearningMechanism_InputStates>`:
        *ACTIVATION_INPUT*,  *ACTIVATION_OUTPUT*, and *ERROR_SIGNAL*.

    error_source : ProcessingMechanism
        the Mechanism that generates the output upon which the error signal received by LearningMechanism
        (in its `ERROR_SIGNAL <LearningMechanism_Input_Error_SIgnal>` InputState) is based.

    learned_projections : List[Projections]
        the Projections, the parameters of which are modified by the LearningMechanism.  Usually this is a single
        `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of a `MappingProjection`.

    function : LearningFunction or function : default BackPropagation
        specifies function used to compute the `learning_signal`.  Must take the following arguments:
        `input` (list or 1d array), `output` (list or 1d array), `derivative` (function) and `error` (list or 1d array).

    learning_rate : float : None
        determines the learning rate for the LearningMechanism.  It is used to specify the :keyword:`learning_rate`
        parameter for the LearningMechanism's `learning function <LearningMechanism.function>`
        (see description of `learning_rate <LearningMechanism_Learning_Rate>` above for additional details).

    error_signal : 1d np.array
        one of two values returned by the LearningMechanism's `function <LearningMechanism.function>`.  For
        `single layer learning <LearningMechanism_Single_Layer>`, this is the same as the value received in the
        LearningMechanism's `ERROR_SIGNAL <LearningMechanism_Input_Error_Signal>` InputState;  for `multilayer
        learning <LearningMechanism_Multi_Layer>`, it is a modified version of the value received, that takes
        account of the contribution to the error signal received, made by the learned_projection and its input.

    learning_signal : number, ndarray or matrix
        one of two values returned by the LearningMechanism's `function <LearningMechanism.function>`,
        that provides the changes to the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter(s) of the
        `MappingProjection(s) <MappingProjection>` being learned (and listed in
        `learned_projections <LearningMechanism.learned_projections>`) required to reduce the
        `error_signal <LearningMechanism.error_signal>`.

    learning_signals : List[LearningSignal]
        list of `LearningSignals <LearningSignals>` for the LearningMechanism, each of which sends a
        `LearningProjection` to the `ParameterState` for the parameter it controls.
        The value of each LearningSignal generally contains a 2d np.array or matrix of changes to be used by recipient
        of a `LearningProjection` from the LearningMechanism, to adjust its parameters (e.g., matrix weights, in which
        rows correspond to sender, and columns to receiver).  Since LearningSignals are OutputStates, these are also
        listed in the ControlMechanism's `output_states <Mechanism.output_states>` attribute, along with its
        *ERROR_SIGNAL* OutputState, and any others it may have.

    output_states : ContentAddressableList[OutputState]
        contains list of OutputStates for the LearningMechanism, including: its LearningSignal(s) which appear(s) at
        the begining of the list; its *ERROR_SIGNAL* OutputState, which appears after the LearningSignal(s); any
        additional (e.g., user-specified) OutputStates, which appear at the end of the list.

    #  FIX: THIS MAY NEED TO BE A 3d array (TO ACCOMDOATE 2d array (MATRICES) AS ENTRIES)
    output_values : 2d np.array
        the initial item(s) is/are the value(s) of the LearningMechanism's LearningSignal(s);  the next is
        the value of its *ERROR_SIGNAL* OutputState (same as `error_signal`);  subsequent items are the value of
        the corresponding OutputStates in the `output_states <Mechanism_Base.outputStates>` attribute.

    modulation : ModulationParam
        the default form of modulation used by the LearningMechanism's `LearningSignals <LearningSignal>`,
        unless they are `individually specified <LearningSignal_Specification>`.

    name : str : default LearningProjection-<index>
        the name of the LearningMechanism.
        Specified in the **name** argument of the constructor for the Projection;
        if not is specified, a default is assigned by ProjectionRegistry
        (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict : Projection.classPreferences
        the `PreferenceSet` for Projection.
        Specified in the **prefs** argument of the constructor for the Projection;
        if it is not specified, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py
        (see :doc:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).
